# Instructions

In 'App.jsx' you will see two counters. 
Neither one currently works.
You should add code so that the right counter
can increment or decrement a variable called
`counter2` and show its value in the `<p>` tag
in that column. Here, you should use standard
JavaScript functionality like `onClick` or
`addEventListener()` and `element.textContent`
or `element.innerHTML`.

Next, make the counter on the left
mimic its neighbor. To do
this, you should use React's `useState` hook to 
create a state variable named `counter1`.
When ready, open up 'App.jsx' and take a look.
